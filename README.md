## Overview

This repository contains resources related to a practical exercise focused on the modernization of banking systems through integration architecture design. The following files are included:

### 1. **Diseño de Arquitectura de Integración para la Modernización de Sistemas Bancarios.pdf**

This PDF document is the **main deliverable** of the practical exercise. It presents a detailed **Integration Architecture Design** for the modernization of banking systems. The document includes:

- A description of the current context and challenges of legacy banking systems.
- The proposed architecture to modernize and integrate various systems.
- Technology recommendations and integration patterns.
- Security and scalability considerations.
- Embedded **C4 Diagrams** to illustrate the architecture at different levels of detail.

The objective of this document is to provide a practical, real-world example of how integration architecture can be applied to transform traditional banking systems, ensuring improved maintainability, flexibility, and support for digital banking services.

### 2. **c4_diagrams.drawio**

This file contains the **C4 diagrams** designed as part of the solution and presented within the PDF. The `.drawio` format allows you to open, edit, and explore the diagrams interactively using [diagrams.net (draw.io)](https://app.diagrams.net/).

#### What are C4 Diagrams?
The **C4 Model** is a framework for visualizing software architecture at multiple levels of abstraction:
- **Level 1:** Context Diagram – shows the system and its interactions with external actors.
- **Level 2:** Container Diagram – details the high-level technology containers within the system.
- **Level 3:** Component Diagram – breaks down the internal components of a container.
- **Level 4:** (optional) Code-level Diagram – shows internal structure like classes or interfaces.

In this exercise, the **C4 diagrams illustrate the proposed integration architecture** by showing how different systems, services, and components interact to support the modernization strategy.

## Usage
- **View the PDF** for the complete architectural design and explanation.
- **Open the `.drawio` file** using diagrams.net to modify or inspect the C4 diagrams used in the solution.

---

## Requirements
- PDF reader to view the document.
- [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) or any compatible tool to open the `.drawio` file.
